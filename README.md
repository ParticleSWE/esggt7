# Engine Swap Guide for GT7
Android version built in Android Studio.

Google review didn't deem this app enough of an app to allow it onto the Google Play Store, so now I share it with the world so that anyone can do whatever they want with it. It really isn't anything special. I made the vast majority of it with the help of ChatGPT since I am an iOS developer and don't know my way around Kotlin at all. The only previous Android developing experience I have is using C#, Xamarin, .MAUI and Visual Studio.
